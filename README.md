Today, I stayed up late and got up. I'm so tired. I'm going back to school tomorrow. All the students in the school went back one after another, but I left some annoying ones in the school. I don't know why, I can't learn them at home, or I can only learn them in the library. I brought the book, but I didn't turn a few pages. ha-ha
